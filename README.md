[![RoseMagura](https://circleci.com/gh/RoseMagura/HostingProject.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/RoseMagura/HostingProject)

## Introduction

I created this project as part of the Udacity Javascript Fullstack
Nanodegree to demonstrate proper public hosting techniques. You
can access a fullstack application on AWS which allows users to view
images of cats.

## Installation

Run `npm run frontend:install` and 
`npm run backend:install` to take care of the project dependencies. 

## Usage

Go to the link [here]() to access the frontend, which is hosted with 
Amazon S3.

## Tests

Just run `npm run test` to execute the jest tests for the frontend
and backend.
