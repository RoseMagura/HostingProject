## Introduction

I created this project as part of the Udacity Javascript Fullstack
Nanodegree to demonstrate proper public hosting techniques. You
can access a fullstack application on Heroku which allows users to view
images of cats.

## Installation

Run `npm run frontend:install` and 
`npm run backend:install` to take care of the project dependencies. 

## Usage

Go to the link [here](https://immense-beach-34253.herokuapp.com/) to access the frontend, which is hosted with 
Heroku.

## Tests

Just run `npm run test` to execute the jest tests for the frontend
and backend. 

## Acknowledgments

Thank to the owners of the images I have borrowed. You can follow
the links in the html source code to see more about who contributed the images.
I appreciate that these images are free on the internet, and I 
do not claim ownership.
